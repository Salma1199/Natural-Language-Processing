# Natural-Language-Processing


Different pieces of the analysis were performed through different pyfiles to allow for running them simultaneously. They were performed in the order shown below:

1. Data creation to focus on condensed matter entries for journals selected: Data_Creation.py. Data created throughout put into folder “Data”
2. Visualizations of Categories & Journals: journal-visual.ipynb in Results folder
3. Predicting Journal using abstract- Naive Bayes Variations: code in Journal-abstract-nb.py, results in Journal-abstract_nb.txt
4. Predicting Journal using abstract- Bert Variations: code in Journal-abstract-bert.py, results in Journal-abstract_nb.txt
5. Predicting Journal using title- Naive Bayes Variations: code in Journal-title-nb.py, results in Journal-title-nb.txt
6. Predicting Journal using title- Bert Variations: code in Journal-title-bert.py, results in Journal-title-bert.txt 
7. Predicting first category using Abstract- Naive Bayes Variations: code and results in category_one_naive.ipynb
8. Predicting first category using Abstract- Bert Variations: code in category_one_bert.py, results in category-one-bert.txt
9. Predicting multi categories using Abstract-Naive Bayes & Bert variations: code and results in multi_category.ipynb in Results folder
10. Predicting journal using abstract for MES-Naive Bayes Variations: code in sub_mes_nb.py, results in sub_mes_nb.txt
11. Predicting journal using abstract for MES-Bert Variations: code in sub_mes_bert.py, results in sub_mes_bert.txt
12. Predicting journal using abstract for MTRL-Naive Bayes Variations: code in sub_mtrl_nb.py, results in sub_mtrl_nb.txt
13. Predicting journal using abstract for MTRL-Bert Variations: code in sub_mtrl_bert.py, results in sub_mtrl_bert.txt
